# Traffic-Light-FSM-Design-and-Simulation
The design controls red, yellow, and green lights with defined timing sequences for each state. Simulated in Vivado to verify state transitions and output behavior under various enable/reset conditions. Optimized for FPGA implementation with parameterized timing for easy hardware or simulation scaling.
